# 100meter.me
 
A (very) simple web app for checking how far you are from an address.

Created to help comply with new Israeli COVID-19 regulations, requiring citizens to remain no more than 100m from home. Not accurate due to browser GPS limitations. Use at own risk.

Requires Google Places + Geocoding API key.
Requires client browser location services to be enabled to run, which requires SSL when deployed.


Not really useful on a desktop :)
