# 100meter
 
A simple web app for checking the distance you travelled from a set point (Which should be your home unless you're naughty).

Created to help comply with new Israeli COVID-19 regulations. Not accurate due to browser GPS limitations. Use at own risk.

Requires allowing location services to be enabled.

Not really useful on a desktop :)
